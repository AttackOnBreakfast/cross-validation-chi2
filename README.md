# Cross-Validation and Chi-Squared Analysis

This project explores how model complexity affects the chi-squared value of polynomial fits under realistic noise, highlighting overfitting through cross-validation.

## Features

- Synthetic dataset generation around a complex truth function
- Polynomial model fitting of varying degrees
- Chi-squared analysis on training vs validation datasets
- Theoretical vs empirical comparison with log-scale visualization

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
